What does this program do?
  This program takes a text file containing lines of HTML code for image elements and converts it to CSS selector code using the image's source URL. This CSS selector can then be used to apply CSS hover effects on a website.

How to use:
  1.) To get the HTML code for an image on a webpage, hover over the image 
  you want and right-click and choose the "Inspect" option.

  2.) The DevTools window will appear and the HTML code will be highlighted.
  The code should start with "<img.." and end with "...>".

  3.) Right-click the highlighted code and choose the "Edit as HTML" option.

  4.) A text-box should appear. Copy all the code in the textbox. You can use 
  the following shortcut to do so: 
        Press (CTRL + A) to Select All
        Press (CTRL + C) to Copy to Clipboard

  5.) Now paste that code into the "input.txt" file located on the left. For an
  input example, look at "example.txt". Your input should look something similar.

  6.) Add more images you want by doing the repeating steps 1-5.

  7.) Once you are finished adding all the HTML image codes, click the green
  "Run" button above. The generated CSS codes should appear in the the "output.txt" Copy the lines to use in your CSS file.
